# MUsim
class for motor unit simulations, produce firing rates according to force profiles;
operates on size principle in "static" mode;
"dynamic" mode applies unit threshold reversals when dF/dt > yank_flip_thresh;
shuffled thresholds can be simulated in "MUsim_2Dkde_pair.py", "MUsim_2Dkde_PCA.py", "MUsim_2Dkde_PCA_multiRun.py".
