# MUsim
class for motor unit simulations, produce firing rates according to arbitrary force profiles;
operates on size principle when in "static" mode;
"dynamic" mode applies unit MU threshold reversals when dF/dt exceeds a threshold value;
shuffled thresholds can also be simulated in "MUsim_2Dkde_pair.py", "MUsim_2Dkde_PCA.py", "MUsim_2Dkde_PCA_multiRun.py".
